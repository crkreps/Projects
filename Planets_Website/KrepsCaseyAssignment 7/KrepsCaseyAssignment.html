<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="tab">Space the final frontier...this is a phrase that is 
commonly mentioned or thought of when we think about outer space. 
Our Solar System is filled with amazing and spectacular bodies. 
These bodies range from the sun to planets to asteroids to stars.</p>

If you were to ask someone ten years ago, what our 
solar system consisted of, they would probably refer to nine planets
and a sun. Now, however you would get a different answer. There are
only eight planets and a sun. The planets in order traveling away 
from the sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
</p> 

<p class="tab">The planet that used to be the ninth is called Pluto. Pluto was declassed 
as a planet in August of 2006, because it does not fit the criteria of a planet. Instead 
it is now classified as a dwarf planet. The planets are divided into two groups. The inner 
solar system is devised of the first four planets. Each of these planets has a rocky solid 
surface. The second half of the solar system consists of the last four planets. These four 
are known as the Gas Giants. They do not have a solid surface. These two groups are also 
divided by an actual physical body, the Asteroid Belt.</p>

<p class="tab">Along with the planets, sun and asteroids, our solar system contains much, 
much more. We have comets, meteorites, moons, gas clouds, and even space debris. Our solar 
system is extremely large. One cannot truly grasp the pure massiveness of our solar system. 
The estimated diameter of our solar system is 11.65 TRILLION miles.</p>

<p class="tab">As you browse this web site, you will find information on many of the objects 
that are in our solar system. There is also a page with links to more in depth discussion 
about our solar system and deep space.</p>
